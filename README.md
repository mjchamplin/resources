# Resources
A directory of resources I find useful while making things.

## Stock Imagery
**[Unsplash Source](https://source.unsplash.com)** -
Unsplash's service for serving images from its extensive collection. You can retrieve an image from the following URL: `https://source.unsplash.com/{size}/?{keyword}` *(keyword optional).* Example:
`https://source.unsplash.com/3000x2000/?mountain`

**[Facebook Devices](http://design.facebook.com/devices)**
Facebook's devices for mockups. Thorough and accurate.Transparent .pngs AND sketch files. 

## Development
**[HTML5 Reset](https://github.com/murtaugh/HTML5-Reset)** -
A bare-bones starter kit for an HTML5 document and a handful of useful reset styles. A little out of date (skim the `<head>` for extemporaneous js calls, etc) but still very good and very minimal.
