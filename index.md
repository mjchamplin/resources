## Design
**[Butterick's Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com)** -
Fantastic resource for basic to intermediate typographical knowledge. A good resource for people non-designers who want to learn more about creating more pleasant, more readable communication.

## Stock Imagery
**[Unsplash Source](https://source.unsplash.com)** -
Unsplash's service for serving images from its extensive collection. You can retrieve an image from the following URL: `https://source.unsplash.com/{size}/?{keyword}` *(keyword optional).* Example:
`https://source.unsplash.com/3000x2000/?mountain`

**[Facebook Devices](http://design.facebook.com/devices)** -
Facebook's devices for mockups. Thorough and accurate.Transparent .pngs AND sketch files. [Diverse Device Hands](https://facebook.design/handskit) is also a cool resource, but the devices are 3 years out of date.

## Development
**[HTML5 Reset](https://github.com/murtaugh/HTML5-Reset)** -
A bare-bones starter kit for an HTML5 document and a handful of useful reset styles. A little out of date (skim the `<head>` for extemporaneous js calls, etc) but still very good and very minimal.

## Social Media
**[Display Purposes](https://displaypurposes.com)** -
"Photo Hashtags for the Modern Trollop." Enter a few hashtags, it'll help you find more hashtags that go with them. This is an annoying thing we have to do to exist as artists online.
